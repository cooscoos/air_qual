# Air quality vs traffic flow
This repo does blah.

## Indoor Air quality 

Geographical location codes names match traffic flow data
- 7a41 (A closer but no data, B and C are 1km away)
- 1b14 (A and B in same home)


Locations contain subfolders A and B if they have more than one monitoring location in a single indoor location.

Note: Times may be 1 hour off due to time diff.

## Outdoor Air quality

Todo, get from BEACONN
